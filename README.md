This application is a simple game in which you guess what the correct flag is, this app was made alongside the [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20) project two tutorial.

## Project plan and journey
The goal of this project was to better understand some of the techniques needed to create useful and functional user interfaces, this included understanding how to use `ZStack`, `VStack` and `HStack`. These components can be used to create more complex user interfaces that provide more dimensions and flexability. This project also used alerts so that the user can know whether their answer was valid and to also display the user's score.

## Overal outcome
In summary this project was an insightful one which helped me realise that in order to successfully solve a problem or create something meaningful, plentiful thought and careful consideration is needed. Whether that be addressing a specific problem domain or trying to understand how to best layout your UI views. These simple begineer projects are essential to understanding how to use different frameworks but also important for blossiming and enchancing deductive reasoning.


## Techniques learned
- Using `Zstack`, `HStack`, `VStack` stacks to arrange views
- Understanding `Buttons` and `Image` components
- Showing alert messages
- Rendering colors and frames
