## Project plan and journey
The goal of this project was to better understand some of the techniques needed to create useful and functional user interfaces, this included understanding how to use `ZStack`, `VStack` and `HStack`. These components can be used to create more complex user interfaces that provide more dimensions and flexability. This project also used alerts so that the user can know whether their answer was valid and to also display the user's score.

Techniques learned:
- Using `Zstack`, `HStack`, `VStack` stacks to arrange views
- Understanding `Buttons` and `Image` components
- Showing alert messages
- Rendering colors and frames
